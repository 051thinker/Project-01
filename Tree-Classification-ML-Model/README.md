This notebook aims to classify trees and give some clues about where to find them! I build a random forest classifier to detect 7 different types of fantastic trees. The notebook will follow the workflow suggested by Will Koehrsen in this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-complete-machine-learning-walk-through-in-python-part-one-c62152f39420).

1) Undserstand, Clean and Format Data

2) Exploratory Data Analysis

3) Feature Engineering & Selection

4) Compare Several Machine Learning Models

5) Perform Hyperparameter Tuning on the Best Model

6) Evaluate the Best Model with Test Data

7) Interpret Model Results

8) Summary & Conclusions

Original kaggle kernel is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/cereniyim/fantastic-trees-where-to-find-how-to-detect-them?scriptVersionId=21676088).

It is one big notebook, for the summary and results you can move directly to the 8. Summary & Conclusions but I cannot gurantee that you are not going to miss some beautiful visualizations and interesting insights about data science and machine learning. Enjoy Reading!
