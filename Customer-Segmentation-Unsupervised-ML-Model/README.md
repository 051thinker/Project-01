In this procject, I worked on a real-world e-commerce sales data and segmented its customer base with Python. 
I decided on features, prepared data accordingly, performed K-means clustering, decided optimal number of clusters and interpreted the results.

- For clustering: K-means clustering algorithm from [scikit-learn library](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html).
- For visualization: Plotly is used.
